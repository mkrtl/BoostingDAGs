# Boosting DAGs
This repository contains the code for using boosting for causal discovery. 
The procedures are described [here](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.06523v1). 

## How to run
For an example, see [example.py](./example.py)!
## Simulation studies
For running the simulation studies with the NOTEARS algorithm, you need to install the repository manually. See the [repo](https://github.com/xunzheng/notears) for more details.

The simulation study for CAM is run using the [Causal Discovery Toolbox](https://github.com/FenTechSolutions/CausalDiscoveryToolbox.git) using R 4.2.2.
## Requirements 
Developed with `python 3.11.8`.
